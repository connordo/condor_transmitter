# condor_transmitter
Repository containing software for a tranmitter I created to control a future drone (or any other project I want)

Important:
This Repository acts as a self-contained Arduino sketchbook. As such, for easiest use, switch the Arduino sketchbook location to the condor_transmitter folder.

To change the Arduino sketchbook location, open up the Arduino IDE. Under File->Preferences (or Ctrl + Comma), you can see the file path for the sketchbook location. change this to the GameDuino Directory. (It should look something like C:\Users\...\condor_transmitter if you're using a Windows Computer).
